								GREENED



				Given the current circumstances in the world today as of December 2020, 
				the COVID-19 Pandemic is still contagious and out there. Face to face interaction 
				is limited given the hazard of contracting the virus, thus this project aims to 
				solve the inconvenience of having to communicate with people who are not by 
				their sides or are far from them. Communication through applications are also widely 
				used especially now that we are in a pandemic situation which is taking long to be gone. 
				his project can be beneficial to everyone not only in the DLSU community but also in the local, 
				national, and international community. Although there are several messaging platforms 
				available in the market today, most of these messaging applications are crowded, meaning 
				there are too many conversations, that sometimes a group chat or a conversation may be 
				listed further down the list because of the volume of messages being exchanged 
				within the application.
